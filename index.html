      <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">For this portion of your grade you will be randomly assigned the profile of a fictional person from on of the four periods we will cover in the course (Heretics and Kings, 1500-1700; Enlightenment and Revolution, 1700-1815; the long Nineteenth Century, 1815-1918; the Violent Twentieth Century, 1918-Present).

      Your assignment will be to use this profile to construct a character, their life events, and fate. Rather than being a pure work of imagination, you must craft a life story for your character based on primary and secondary sources. You will be graded on your use of sources, the plausibility of your character's life story, and creativity.<br><br>
        ***Circumstances of history are often ugly, violent, and unequal but we must treat our characters, (even though fictional) with dignity; understanding that they stand for real linces, many fo which were cut short as a result of circumstance, war, accident, intolerance, racism, and brutality.
        As you create (and end) imaginative lives, you must be conscious to not make light of their circumstances or perpetuate sterotypes and caricatures which helped justify inequalities and violence in the first place. In the end, these stereotypes tell us less about the transgression of this principle will be dealt with forcefully. If you have a question about what constitutes appropriate -ask!

      <h3 style="font-family:helvetica;">Timeline to complete project:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>
                <p style="font-family:helvetica;">You are free to begin the project whenever you wish. In order to complete the NW Online Message board posting and response element, you'll need to coordinate with someone else in your group.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p style="font-family:helvetica;">If you choose to not begin early, everyone assigned to a group must have started and completed the project within the following dates:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Heretics and Kings - Weeks 3-8</li>
                  <li>Enlightenment and Revolution - Weeks 4-9</li>
                  <li>The Long Nineteenth Century - Weeks 5-10</li>
                  <li>The Violent Twentieth Century - Weeks 9-14</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="PhaseI" style="font-family:verdana;">Phase I: Identifying Possible Life Events Worksheet</h1>
      <h4>Purpose and Description:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">The purpose of the “Identifying Possible Life Events” portion of the avatar project is to give you a general sense of the different historical events that shaped the period in which your character lived and which might have influenced their life and/or decisions.  This information is critical as it will enable you to make an informed decision about when to begin and end your character’s life, as well give you a number of different events about which you can look up primary and secondary sources.</h5>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 style="font-family:helvetica;">Tips:</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>
          <h5 class="display-4"style="font-family:helvetica;">One way to begin this process is to read our textbook chapters that correspond to your character’s timeline.  For instance, if your character is alive in the 16th century (1500s), you could begin by looking through chapters 12, 13, and 14.  As you read, look for events that are mentioned as specifically happening in your country, as well as those that happened somewhere else, but might have also influenced your character’s life (keep in mind that you would need to be able to justify this effect with evidence from sources you find).  Some of the chapters in the textbook have more of a thematic rather than a strictly chronological organization.  Therefore you should also take a look at chapters that do not have a specific set of dates in their title.  For instance, Chapter 16, “The New Science of the Seventeenth Century,” also has information pertinent to the 1500s. </h5>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">Another possibility is to go to the NWMSU’s library’s homepage and search “A history of ___________”.  This will bring up a large number of results that you can further refine.  If you are only interested in books that our library owns is to click on the “Books & Movies” tab.</h5>
       </li>
     </ul>
     <h1 id="PhaseII" style="font-family:verdana;">Phase II: Character Background Entry</h1>
     <h4>Description:</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>
           <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">This portion of the avatar project asks you to begin constructing the background of your character.  This information will be critical in determining the subsequent life events and fate of your avatar.</h5>
       </li>
     </ul>
     <h4 style="font-family:helvetica;">Content of Assignment:</h4>
     <ul>
      <li>
         <h5 class="display-4">Basic questions you might wish to consider: What is your character’s name?  What is their gender? Where do they live?  How old are they?  What do they look like?  What is their familial situation – do they have children (how many), a spouse, a significant other?  What is their occupation?  Are they religious?  If so, what is their denomination?  Are they political?  Which way do their politics lean?  How do they view people in authority?  What are their primary concerns?  What are their goals in life?  How can your character achieve them?  What is standing in the way of your character realizing these goals?</h5>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">Make sure that you provide sufficient background information to understand the current events in which your character is involved, as well as necessary information (place, time, involved characters, etc.) to understand the story and historical event(s) being discussed.</h5>
      </li>
     </ul>
     
    <h4 style="font-family:helvetica;">Information for Timeline Assignment:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">The final step in this part of the Avatar Project is to commit the information you have developed in this section to a unique Timeline (<a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/">http://timeline.knightlab.com/ </a>).  You will continue adding to the Timeline throughout the remainder of the avatar project.</h5>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="PhaseIII" style="font-family:verdana;">Phase III: Living the Life: Decisions and Consequences Entry</h1>
    <h4>General Description of the Decision Narrative Assignment:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
          <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">Your character is required to interact with one significant historical event over the course of their lifetime.  Regardless of the events you select, the interaction must involve decision making and should shape your character’s subsequent life story accordingly.  Ultimately, you must justify the plausibility of the interaction/decision and demonstrate how the scenario you create would have been a potential real option.   In other words, a 19th C worker cannot be working in an automobile factory, be abducted by aliens, or marry a queen (unless you have hard evidence that any of these scenarios happened).</h5>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">Make sure that you provide sufficient background information to understand the current events in which your character is involved, as well as necessary information (place, time, involved characters, etc.) to understand the story and historical event(s) being discussed.</h5>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
   <h4 style="font-family:helvetica;">Information for Timeline Assignment:</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">The final steps in these phases of the Avatar Project is to commit the information you have developed in these sections to your Timeline (<a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/">http://timeline.knightlab.com/ </a>).  You will continue adding to the Timeline throughout the remainder of the avatar project.</h5>
     </li>
   </ul>

   <h1 id="PhaseIV" style="font-family:verdana;">Phase IV: The Fate of the Avatar Entry</h1>
   <h4 style="font-family:helvetica;">General Description of the Fate Narrative Assignment:</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>
         <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">This final entry should revolve around the fate (i.e. death) of your character.  Rather than being a lightning bolt out of the sky, you should once again consider your character’s background, the circumstances of their lives, and the historical events that were happening around them.  You should also consider whether or not your character achieved their life goals.</h5>
     </li>
     <li>
       <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">Make sure that you provide sufficient background information to understand the current events in which your character is involved, as well as necessary information (place, time, involved characters, etc.) to understand the story and historical event(s) being discussed.</h5>
     </li>
     <li class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">You have the latitude to decide how long (or short) your character lives, but keep in mind the realities of the time period in which the character was living.  For instance, not many people lived to be 80 in the 16th C!</li>
   </ul>
   
  <h4 style="font-family:verdana;">Information for Timeline Assignment:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5 class="display-4" style="font-family:helvetica;">The final steps in these phases of the Avatar Project is to commit the information you have developed in these sections to your Timeline (<a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/">http://timeline.knightlab.com/ </a>).
